// Now, let's break this down into interactive steps for a clearer understanding:

/**
 * 1. **`chains`**:
 *    - We're defining two blockchain networks here: Ethereum Mainnet and Sepolia (a test network). 
 *    - **Mainnet** is the primary Ethereum network where real transactions occur.
 *    - **Sepolia** is a test network where developers can test contracts without using real ETH.
 *  
 *    Why two chains? 
 *    - Mainnet for live interactions with the blockchain.
 *    - Sepolia for safe, cost-free testing before deploying to the real world.

 * 2. **`transports`**:
 *    - This part defines the method by which we interact with the blockchain. In this case, we're using `http()` for both networks.
 *    - `http()` means all blockchain interactions will be via HTTP requests, a simple and widely-supported method.
 *    - Transport methods can also include WebSockets or other protocols, depending on the use case.
 *
 *    Why HTTP transport?
 *    - It's often the simplest and most reliable method for interacting with blockchain nodes.

 * 3. **`walletConnectProjectId`**:
 *    - This is a unique API key for WalletConnect. It allows our app to interact with different wallet providers (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet) for signing transactions.
 *    - The ID is stored in environment variables to keep sensitive data secure.
 *  
 *    Why is this required?
 *    - WalletConnect Project ID connects our app to the WalletConnect infrastructure, which enables users to connect their wallets securely.
 *  
 * 4. **`appName`**:
 *    - This sets the name of the app that will appear when a user connects their wallet via WalletConnect.
 *    - It's a great way for users to know which app is requesting access to their wallets.
 *
 *    Why is this helpful?
 *    - It ensures that users are aware of which application is requesting their wallet connection, improving trust and security.
